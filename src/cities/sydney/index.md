Sydney, Australia is a nice warm place with lots of activities that tourists can participate in. It features many beaches, modern architecture. Tourists also love to visit the museums there, such as the Australian National Maritime Museum. For transportation, people use their buses, trains, taxis, e.t.c. Keep in mind that taxis often round up in the nearest Australian Dollar and tipping culture there is minimal, only really tipping if service felt exceptional.
